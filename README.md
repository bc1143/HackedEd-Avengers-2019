Our goal is to create proof of concept application that will empower users to become more financially fit with their day to day transactions.
The application should be able to take a picture of a receipt and extract vital information from it, which will be stored on a database.
The application will also allow you to select a category for the purchase. This can help the user plan fiscally by showing the user how much they are spending, and on what they are spending, over a time period.

The plan:
-connect phone to computer
-use python to convert picture to pdf
