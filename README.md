Our goal is to create proof of concept application that will empower users to become more financially fit with their day to day transactions.
The application should be able to take a picture of a receipt and extract vital information from it, which will be stored on a database.
The application will also allow you to select a category for the purchase. This can help the user plan fiscally by showing the user how much they are spending, and on what they are spending, over a time period.
This data can then be analyzed, and recommendations will be given to the individual based off his/her spending habits.


RECEIPT PARSER:
-picture taken by computer webcam and converted into text with Tesseract
-obtains store name, type of store, money spent, as well as type of payment
-date is manually entered to ensure maximum accuracy
-all this data is stored on a .csv file

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS:
-presents database results (pie graph and bar graph) 
-always individual to view how much money they are spending on different categories (ie. fast food, retail, etc.)
